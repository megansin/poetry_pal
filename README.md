Code files are Jupyter Notebook files. The notebooks contain code we used to create and train the neural CF model as well as the recommendation results. As it takes a long time to train, you can also download the pretrained model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dCBwrthN5bRDWN8pUO5lPo8iAnpjMBSU/view?usp=sharing)

Data files are not stored in this repository, but the datasets can be found on our website on the 'Dataset' page: https://megansin.github.io/poetry_pal/dataset/

Poetry Pal is a comprehensive and user-friendly poetry recommendation tool that aims to show users new pieces of poetry they might enjoy! Poetry Pal uses usersâ€™ past ratings to make new poetry recommendations.
